This game was created using pure JS inside the browser console. In the future, I plan to implement buttons and GUI elements
once I get accomodated to DOM manipulation.

Initial idea for implementation:
 - The program will take in three forms of input from the user: Rock, paper, or scissors. 
 - Any extraneous input will throw an error and re-prompt the user.
 - The 'AI' will then select a number 0-2 randomly and base its selection off of this (0 being rock, 1 paper, and 2 scissors).
    and display its selection to the user.
 - The game will loop until one wins (to prevent a tie from ending the game prematurely)
 - Conditional statements will then be used to select a prompt regarding the winner
